About
=====

The LiveTribe Plugins distribution contains a simple Python plugin
framework.  It defines no classes that need to be implemented nor imposes
arbitrary lifecycle events or special plugin information files.

Inspired by Calvin Spealman's straight plugin, https://github.com/ironfroggy/straight.plugin.
